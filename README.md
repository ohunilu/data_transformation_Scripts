> A collection of powerful, practical, and well-documented Python scripts designed to transform data and supercharge your workflow.

## 🚀 The "Why" Behind This Repository

My simple philosophy to learning is **learning by doing.**. I got tired of just watching endless tutorials and reading technical books and just want to start building anything with the knoweledge I have. I decisded to create this repo as a digital diary of the little skills I pick up as I improve my skills.

This repository is my digital workshop. It's a living testament to that philosophy—a place where I build, break, learn, and share scripts that transform data from one form to another or restructure data. I have written each scripts to be easy to read and reusable so that it can save me time when build a future project that requires these skills

**Heads up, I'm a Linux enthusiast!** 🐧 While most scripts are written in cross-platform Python, you might occasionally find a bash command or a Linux-centric path.

## 📦 What's in the Toolbox?

Explore the folders to find scripts that tackle a variety of tasks:

- **🌐 Web Scraping & Automation:** Extract data, monitor websites, and interact with web pages.
- **🖥️ Converters:** Scripts to convert files from one format to another eg csv,parquet,avro.

_(...and more to come as I continue to learn and automate!)_

## 🛠️ Getting Started: Your Quick-Start Guide

Ready to dive in? Here’s how to get any script in this repository up and running on your machine in minutes.

### Installation & Setup

I **highly recommend** using a virtual environment for each project. It keeps dependencies neat, tidy, and conflict-free. Here's the magic ritual:

1.  **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/data_transformation_scripts.git
    cd data_transformation_scripts
    ```

2.  **Navigate to your desired script's folder:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/specific_script_folder
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment _inside that folder_:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the environment:**

    - **On Linux/macOS:** `source venv/bin/activate`
    - **On Windows (Command Prompt):** `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
    - **On Windows (PowerShell):** `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps` (You may need to enable scripts first: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`)

    _(You'll know it worked if you see `(venv)` at the start of your command line!)_

5.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6.  **Run the script!**

    Check the README file inside the script folder on the exact command to run it.

7.  **Deactivate the environment when you're done:**
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## 🎯 Final Thought

Scripting isn't about being lazy; it's about being smart. It's about freeing up your most valuable resource—**your time and mental energy**—so you can focus on the creative, challenging, and meaningful work that truly matters.

I hope these scripts serve you well. Happy building, and even happier automating!
